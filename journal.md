claim-i really think the new cell phone banned in texas isn't really gonna help test scores. even if we are the lowest in testing that doesn't mean banned phones it like saying "this person has ate too many burgers let banned burgers".
evidence- when the bill was passed the governor of texas stated that it was made due to low credit scores, less cyber bullying, better mental health, classroom management, and more social interaction. but yet low credit scores aren't based on a group it based on the person who pays attention, then less cyber bullying which is werid because it everywhere it isn't gonna stop just in texas, mental health is weird too because you need a phone or cellular device to get mental health help, classroom mangement is something based on phones it based on the teacher and how they choose to manage there class, and finally more social interaction this is the most werid since most people meet online and meeet up which can be dangerous but you don'ty have to meet them in real life.
reasoning-in all total i really don't get the cell phone banned since i am writing this on a computer from the school, tech is always gonna get better and students are gonna be more sneaky about using the phones and this will cause more problems between students and teacher.
