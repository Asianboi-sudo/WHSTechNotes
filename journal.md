claim-i really think the new cell phone banned in texas isn't really gonna help test scores. even if we are the lowest in testing that doesn't mean banned phones it like saying "this person has ate too many burgers let banned burgers".
evidence- when the bill was passed the governor of texas stated that it was made due to low credit scores, less cyber bullying, better mental health, classroom management, and more social interaction. but yet low credit scores aren't based on a group it based on the person who pays attention, then less cyber bullying which is weird because it everywhere it isn't gonna stop just in texas, mental health is weird too because you need a phone or cellular device to get mental health help, classroom mangement is something based on phones it based on the teacher and how they choose to manage there class, and finally more social interaction this is the most werid since most people meet online and meeet up which can be dangerous but you don'ty have to meet them in real life.
reasoning-in all total i really don't get the cell phone banned since i am writing this on a computer from the school, tech is always gonna get better and students are gonna be more sneaky about using the phones and this will cause more problems between students and teacher.

claim-computer science really does chnage a normal person life with the technology we have, there is coding and programming in it for it to function a certain way that the coder want it.
evidence-in the video we have programming everywhere in phones,apps,computers,and anything that has tech in it will most likey have a bit of coding in it like inventor and coder who worked at big companys like apple,google etc has always coded technology for it to function a certain series of ways. and with tech adavancing every day the coding for them are always be there since we can't just make a piece of tech with no coding for it to function.
reason- in all computer science and coding can be a changing life chance as the coding can help people find location,help in hospital, or just everything life uses.

Claim- ikea is creating new opportunities by opening a virtual store on roblox where people can get paid to work.
evidence- the article explains that IKEA launched a roblox store called "the co-worker game", and some people can apply for paid roles inside the game.
reason - this shows that ikea is blending gaming with real life job experience. by paying people to work in roblox, ikea is using a real creative way to connect with the younger audiences and give them a real sense of world responsibility and also to promote the brand in a fun way
 This response used AI.

The meaning of 67 comes from a music video called Doot Doot by rapper Skrilla. There is no real meaning behind it a catchy phrase people say. not everyone says it people use it but not as before. the meaning of 67 is catchy to say. but the phrase have gotten old. Students will say it like once in maybe.But the meaning just comes from a song.

If i was in charge of a school and the policy on phones,this is what I would do. first i would allow phones, making it to where student can't use a phone in school is useless, all it making the student do is being more sneaky. Now for AI it would be different, if AI was use just a little bit in a story then i wouldn't care but if it was the whole thing then no because that is not a good. but i wouldn't banned phones in school, like if there was an accident that happen and you don't wanna tell the admin because it is personal then i get that. If really the phones are a big problem then i would just a time/period to where student can't use their phone by j=having teachers put it in a bag or jar. and to get it after class because that is there right to have a phone.

Now the way how my program or short intro game into computer science help is that we get a test on how much knowledge they know. for example i created a 5 question quiz for a starter to get learn into computer science. so the way canva helped me interpet it, is by helping me make a long all year class into a short question quiz. but next time for the design i maybe probably add more deep answers then the short ones i have done.
